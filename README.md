# Simple command line hangman game
This is my first attempt at making a simple application in Python. 
Currently it is a very simple game consisting of 4 files all within the `src/` directory.

It accepts an input to set the difficulty, then renders some ascii art for the graphics **So fancy!**

During my time playing with it I was just using Python 3.9.2 to execute the program.

To run the application simply download the source files and run the `src/main.py` to launch the game.
